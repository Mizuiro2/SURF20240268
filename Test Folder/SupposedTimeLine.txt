This is the proposed time line, here suppose have 8 weeks

week1:Read journal and select reasonable aspect,(try to come up with the idea)
week2:Idea,data set


The following three part is of great importance
week3:Theory Method     
week4:Numerical model   (Learn something about digital signal processing if we can)
week5:Experiment        (important part)
Actually These three part is not all compulsory, just one or two of them is also acceptable.
The main problem is that we need enough workload. And most EI conference paper only accept 5 pages of paper, to write all of these three could
exceed this limitation and need more fees


week6:Result analysis/Discussion,Title,Abstract,Introduction
week7:Conclusion,references,revise
week8:revise and try to make publication(EI conference,stable Engineering Index searching required)

Why choose Stable EI searching conference as goal?
Though we are beginners in research region.
At least I do think we need to made something at least in academic form, in another word, publishable way, and conference like this could be a good choice.
