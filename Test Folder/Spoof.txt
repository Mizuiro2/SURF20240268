Aspect 1:
Anti-spoofing (Detect fake speech)
E.g. svc model which can generate fake Audio


Open source data sets:
1.Fully spoofed audio datasets:
ASVspoof 2019 to 2021
FakeorReal-orginal
WaveFake
Sample rate or any other info show in:Audio Anti-Spoofing Detection: A Survey (Table 1)
2.Partially spoofed audio datasets.
psynd,PartialSpoof,ADD 2022 and 2023, HAD
3.Full real
VCTK,LibriSpeech,VoxCeleb,LJspeech,AISHELL


Two child aspects: logical access and physical access
